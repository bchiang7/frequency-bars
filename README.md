# Frequency Bars Experiment with p5.js

From this tutorial https://youtu.be/2O3nm0Nvbi4


## Setup
To run this project you'll need to run a [local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

`npm install -g http-server`


Fire up the server with `http-server` and point your browser at `http://localhost:8080/`

To see local changes reflected, you need to **hard reload** the page (in google chrome if you have inspector open, `shift + cmd + R`)
